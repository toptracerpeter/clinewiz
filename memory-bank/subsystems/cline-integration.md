# Cline Integration

## Responsibilities
- Define structure for prompt-aid content users can copy into Cline (descoped).
- Focus on navigation/editing workflows; no automatic dispatch.

## Interfaces
- None (descoped). No automatic dispatch to Cline.

## Sketch
Descoped. Automatic prompting removed; users craft prompts manually in Cline.
